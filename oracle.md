GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY vs. GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY:
- GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY: Oracle always generates the value for the identity column. You cannot explicitly provide a value during an INSERT statement; attempting to do so will result in an error.
- GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY: Oracle generates the value by default if no value is provided during an INSERT. However, you can explicitly provide a value for the identity column if needed.
